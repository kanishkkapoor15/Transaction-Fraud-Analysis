üß† Project: Transaction Fraud Detection for a Payment App

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 1: Problem Framing & Planning

Goal: Set business context and define measurable objectives.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
1.1	Define the problem clearly (e.g., ‚ÄúPredict if a transaction is fraudulent.‚Äù)	Business framing
1.2	Understand project impact (e.g., cost of false positives/negatives)	Applied DS thinking
1.3	Set performance goal (e.g., precision > 90% on fraud detection)	Real-world trade-offs


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 2: Data Exploration & Cleaning

Goal: Explore the structure, clean up messiness, and spot early patterns.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
2.1	Load and inspect the dataset: shape, columns, types	EDA basics
2.2	Handle missing values (if any)	Missing data strategy
2.3	Explore distributions: amount, fraud rate, etc.	Descriptive statistics
2.4	Check skewness, outliers (log-scale plots, boxplots)	Data understanding
2.5	Visualize fraud patterns by time, country, user behavior	Data storytelling


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 3: Feature Engineering

Goal: Extract meaningful features that highlight fraud signals.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
3.1	Create hour_of_day, day_of_week from timestamps	Temporal feature extraction
3.2	Flag for foreign_transaction: home ‚â† transaction country	Rule-based signal
3.3	Create is_new_device: device ‚â† historical device	Behavioral feature
3.4	Rolling transaction frequency per user (optional)	Aggregation + time windows
3.5	Normalize amount (log_amount)	Log-transform, scaling


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 4: Statistical & Hypothesis Analysis

Goal: Strengthen interpretation using statistics.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
4.1	Compare fraud rates across countries using proportions	Chi-square test
4.2	t-test on amount for fraud vs non-fraud transactions	Inferential statistics
4.3	Correlation matrix for numeric features	Relationship analysis


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 5: Modeling (Classification)

Goal: Build, tune, and evaluate ML models for fraud detection.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
5.1	Handle class imbalance: SMOTE / undersampling	Class imbalance strategy
5.2	Train baseline Logistic Regression	Interpretability
5.3	Train ensemble models: Random Forest / XGBoost	Model robustness
5.4	Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearch)	Optimization
5.5	Evaluate: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC	Model performance


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 6: Threshold Tuning & Business Evaluation

Goal: Fine-tune outputs to maximize real-world value.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
6.1	Adjust decision threshold (0.5 ‚Üí optimal)	Probabilistic decision-making
6.2	Evaluate confusion matrix and fraud catch rate	Cost-sensitive evaluation
6.3	Compare precision-recall trade-off curves	Visualization & strategy


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 7: Visualization & Reporting

Goal: Communicate insights to technical + non-technical stakeholders.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
7.1	Plot fraud by country, time, amount	Insightful visualizations
7.2	Display model metrics using plots	ROC, confusion matrix
7.3	Create 2‚Äì3 ‚Äústorytelling slides‚Äù or dashboard (optional Streamlit)	Stakeholder communication


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 8: Documentation & Delivery

Goal: Finalize project for portfolio / presentation.

Step	Description	Concepts Practiced
8.1	Clean up code & add markdown cells (if using Jupyter)	Clarity
8.2	Write a clear README (problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí results)	Documentation
8.3	Summarize key findings and next steps	Strategic thinking
8.4	Optional: Turn into blog post or LinkedIn project	Personal branding
